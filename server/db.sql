    'Fresh stretched curd cheese with cream, in brine.
Galbani Burrata will take your love for mozzarella to the next level. Originating from the Apulia region in Southern Italy, Burrata is one of Italy`s most beloved cheeses. It is mozzarella formed into a pouch and filled with cream and ribbons of mozzarella that give it a delicious soft texture. Galbani Burrata has a mild, smooth and fresh milk flavour that makes it very versatile. Enjoy it with moist tomatoes, basil, crusty bread and a drizzle of olive oil for the ultimate Italian taste experience. You can also serve Burrata in pasta, pizza or simply have it on its own with seasoning. The best way to fully taste the flavours of Burrata is to enjoy it at an ambient temperature.
Galbani® is Italy`s favourite cheesemaker, producing many of Italy`s most loved cheeses since 1882.

    'Fermented oat product, Greek style, with added vitamins and minerals.
So if we wanted to incorporate geography into the name of this product, why not Oatgurt Landskrona Style? It would have been more logical, since this product was both invented and manufactured in Landskrona, Sweden. And even though this amazing stuff is used in the same way as Greek yogurt, it is far from Greek yogurt — theoretically, even further from the yogurt part than from the Greek part, since it is completely free of dairy, while the Greek city of Thessaloniki is only 2,399 kilometres from our factory in Landskrona. Of course all of this is really, really far off from what we are here to tell you about on this webpage which is that Oatgurt Greek Style has a thick, smooth and creamy texture combined with a fresh and pleasantly sour flavour. Not to brag, but this is among the best* products we have ever created, if not the best webpage copy.',
